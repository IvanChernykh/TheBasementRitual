  noteText: "It's not that I believe in monsters or anything... but with all these
    rumors about strange whispers, missing people, and this unknown cult, I think
    it wouldn\u2019t hurt to find some information about protection against curses
    or demons, just in case. Please, make 2 copies for me, and don't laugh!\n\nP.S.\nAlso,
    could you grab some salt from the dining room for me? Leave it somewhere near
    the copies. Thank you."
