  noteText: "Ritual to Banish the Demon\n\n- The ritual must be performed at the
    location where the demon was summoned.\n- Before beginning, create a protective
    circle of salt around yourself. This barrier will prevent the demon from interfering
    with the ritual.\n- Set the object tied to the demon on fire.\n- Begin reading
    the exorcism incantation aloud.\n- Continue reciting the incantation until the
    tied object is completely reduced to ash. Stay within the salt circle until the
    fire burns out and the air feels still, confirming the demon\u2019s banishment.\n"
