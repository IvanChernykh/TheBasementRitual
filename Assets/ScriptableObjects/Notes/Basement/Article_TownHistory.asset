  noteText: "Tunnels of the Old Castle\n\nNearly 300 years ago, our town was a fortified
    stronghold with a grand castle standing proudly at its center. Beneath this imposing
    fortress lay an intricate network of underground tunnels, which served multiple
    purposes - from secret escape routes to storage spaces.\n\nThough the castle
    has long since vanished from the landscape, many believe that parts of these
    tunnels may still remain beneath some of the city\u2019s older buildings. Some
    passageways may be sealed or forgotten, while others might still connect hidden
    corners of the city\u2019s historic layout."
