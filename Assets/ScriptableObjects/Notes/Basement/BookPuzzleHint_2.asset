  noteText: 'Julius Caesar, known for his military genius, political reforms, and
    the expansion of the Roman Empire, celebrated four grand triumphs to mark victories
    in Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and Numidia.

    He was also a master of secret communication.
    To protect his messages, he employed a clever technique: shifting the letters
    of the alphabet. By moving each letter forward by a set number of places, his
    words became unreadable to his enemies. Only those who knew the key - how many
    positions to shift - could decode the message. This simple yet effective method
    became known as the Caesar Cipher.'
